# About Second Chance👋

This project is to enable people to easily access, be made aware and utilize the various  ‘previously-owned’ everyday items and hostel necessities to get the best out of waste, at a fair price,  primarily focused on the student community, including hostels like that of MIT Manipal.

## Inspiration for the Project:>👩‍💻
With the current problems of Global Warming, Contamination and Pollution, Fast Fashion and Textile Waste and their adverse effect on Health, it has never been more important to think about our individual and collective impact on the world we live in.

“We don’t have to sacrifice a strong economy for a healthy environment.” -Dennis Weaver

By making little changes to help reduce waste,  these small steps can turn into bigger steps encouraging others to make small changes too.
Taking inspiration from a Telegram Group already existing for this purpose in MIT Manipal, and expanding upon it, is our website ‘2 Chance’, where both sellers and buyers are students across streams; it consists of and portrays several goods(second-hand) for buyers to purchase at economical prices and thereby allows sellers to do away with their expendable items at reasonable prices in an environment-friendly way.
